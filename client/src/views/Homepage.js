        We are a dedicated community of dreamers hoping to connect the globe
        with the power that the 3d printer has given us . The world was blessed
        with this invention to help bring costs down to labor as well as product
        creation and simply object replication or cloning . 3DreamPrint allows
        the unfortunate to be able to make requests to our user base , once the
        request has been made , the request will be posted on our global hub of
        requests where our local technicians might take your request and fufill
        your 3DreamPrint!{" "}

      <p className="request-info">
        {" "}
        3D printing is a way of creating three dimensional (3D) solid objects.
        3D printing is done by building up the object layer by layer. Usually,
        3D printers use plastic, because it is easier to use and cheaper. Some
        3D printers can 3D print with other materials, like metals and ceramics,
        but they cost too much money for most people.3D printers are useful
        because they can make new objects very fast, and are good at making them
        very detailed. This means an engineer can test a lot of new designs and
        not have to wait for someone else to make them. They are also useful for
        fixing parts made of plastic, and for making toys, figures, and models.
        There are a lot of people who print 3D objects at home!{" "}
